# NSS Single Page Applications Exercise: 
## What You See is What You Get

## Goals
  * Print values from an array of objects to the DOM utilizing dot notation. 
  * Use event listeners to enact a chain of events.

## Requirements
* an array of objects that represents famous people
* a text input
* block element conatiner (output)

### DOM Dynamics
* DOM elements/cards for each of the famous person objects printed inside the output container (custom style)

### CSS
* For every even numbered element, have a light yellow background.
* For every odd numbered element, have a light blue background.

### Card Functionality
* When you click on one of the person elements, a dotted border appears around the card and the input gains focus.
* When there is a highlighted person element (dotted border) and you begin typing in the input box, the person's bio is overwritten to what you type in the input.
* When you press the enter/return key when typing in the input field, the content of the input field is cleared.
